you can build the project, and you will get the .jar file in your
out directory. same operation can be down in terminal. you can learn 
how to finish this in terminal in [stackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10132818/8985108)
2. If you use IDE the executable jar is in the **out/artifacts/ExpertSystem/** directory.
